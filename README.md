# Six key typing

This prototype is based on an idea by [Rick Buter](https://github.com/Rick712). After observing Marijn he came up with this idea where you only need six keys to type all common Latin letters, including the most common punctuation. 

Itâ€™s a prototype. A common keyboard is more powerful.
